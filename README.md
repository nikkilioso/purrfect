# The Purrfect Pussycat
## By Nikki Trucco
In this app, the user is presented with two cat images on their screen. They must select their favorite cat. When they click on their favorite, a new image to will replace the unselected image. Their favorite cat's name will be displayed each time in a smaller window at the bottom of the screen.

At this point the user must choose between a new cat and their old favorite. This process is un-ending, as the user may never be satisfied with their final choice.
